## Solution !!
Use Google Chrome addons `'Simple Websocket Client'` to connect to `ws://localhost:9000/ws`

## Assignment
Welcome to the scala test assignment.

It is up to you to choose the technical stack, however we suggest that you use one which is relevant to the position you are interviewing for and with which you are proficient.

If in doubt, please choose Akka HTTP with Circe as a JSON serializer, and sbt as the build tool.

A client UI is not required, however, if you develop one using Scala.js it will be appreciated. It is, however, completely optional.

The server should be able to handle multiple concurrent clients.

The server should authenticate user "admin" with password "admin" successfully.

The WS server should be hosted on port 9000 and the URL /ws_api.

## Add your boilerplate code to your project repository
`git add .`

`git commit -m 'Initial commit of test assignment'`

`git push -u origin master`
